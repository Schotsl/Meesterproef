# Meesterproef

This repository contains my Meesterproof assignment, the final assignment for the minor in Visual Interface Design (VID) within Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD) bachelor's program at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA).

This project is developed using Next.js, using the OpenAI API to deliver a unique user experience. Each push to the repository triggers an automatic deployment to Vercel. To maintain high code standards, I employ Prettier and ESLint.
